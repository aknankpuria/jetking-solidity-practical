 Q2 -> Write a Smart Contract for understanding Iterative Statements in Solidity Programming Language.

 ANS -> Iterative Statements are also reffered as a LOOPING Statements .
         
         In Solidity we have the main four loops .
         1 -> for ( ){  }        [for loop ]
         2 -> while ( ) {  }     [while loop]
         3 -> do { } while( )     [do while loop ]
         4 -> for each (){ }      [ for each loop ]



         #further coding example and coding explanaion is included in  ` Q2.Sol ` file
